Low Lit Toolkit - Send & Recieve Interfaces Only
=================

This is a test app for showcasing and applying some of the interaction design principles for the [Low Lit Toolkit](https://ideocolab.com/lowlittoolkit) created by a team at [IDEO CoLab](https://www.ideocolab.com/).

This repo is intended to be used as a mobile demo display of **interactions** on an iPhone, all other research tests were conducted on Android phones with Figma.

This repo is a **truncated experience with only the send and recieve interface**, to play with a demo of **full experience that has not been truncated**, [go here](https://github.com/jacobwaites/lowlittoolkit-pesasalama).
